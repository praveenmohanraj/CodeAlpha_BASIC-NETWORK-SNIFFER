Advanced Network Sniffer in Python
This project is an advanced network sniffer implemented in Python. The network sniffer is built using the Scapy library, allowing it to capture and analyze network traffic, providing insights into how data flows on a network and how network packets are structured.

Features
Packet Capture: Captures packets from the specified network interface in real-time.
Protocol Analysis: Analyzes captured packets to identify various network protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
Detailed Packet Analysis: Extracts information such as source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and protocol type for each captured packet.
Filtering: Allows users to specify filter expressions to capture specific types of packets based on protocols or ports.
Flexibility: Supports both wired and wireless network interfaces and can be used on different operating systems.
